This is a simple Todo application that is entirely written in Typescript.

## Introduction

`toDone` is a full stack Todo application that I wrote using the `PERN` stack (PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).
The `PERN` stack is one of the most widely used JavaScript stacks in the Web development industry.
I chose this stack because I have some familiarity with it as I already used it to create projects.
